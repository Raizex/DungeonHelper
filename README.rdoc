== Dungeon Helper

Dungeon Helper is a character sheet creator and manager for the 
{Pathfinder Roleplaying Game}[http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG]. 
As a group of avid tabletop gamers, we have often found it somewhat 
tedious to carry around a bunch of character sheets which eventually become unreadable due 
to all the erasing and re-writing and pizza, and frequently get lost. 
To fix this issue, we have created (or are in the process of creating) Dungeon Helper, a tool for table top gamers
that allows them to easily create new characters and have one place in the cloud to access them all from any computer.

General info:
* Ruby version: 2.0.0
* Rails version: 4.0.0

What works:
* User accounts
* Create new character walks you through the character creation process for description, attributes, race, class, and feats.
* A static character sheet page that displays your character and everything that you chose during character creation
* Fighter class
* Dwarf/Elf races
* A handful of feats

What we have not yet implemented:
* Character sheet real time view
* Edit character only allows you to edit the name, summary, and campaign of the character for now
* Leveling up
* Prompts to tell the user what to roll for attacks/spells
* Character sheet items: spells, skills, equipment, and hit-points
