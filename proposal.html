<html><body><p>Project Proposal<br />================<br /><br />Overview of Goals<br />=================<br /><br />Pathfinder is an open source table-top role playing game which is usually played by rolling dice and writing down character statistics with pen and paper on a single sheet. This requires a lot of erasing and re-writing, and combat is often difficult and slow because the player needs to look up a large amount of information in physical books in order to determine what dice they need to roll and what modifiers they need to add. We feel that this process could be significantly streamlined by using software to keep track of this information and to inform players what rolls need to be made. However, the only peices of software that exist are costly and unweildly or are not made for local games with all players gathered around a table - the way the game was originally intended to be played. Because of this, we propose to create a web-based application in Ruby on Rails that will allow users to create characters, view and edit their characters, and "level-up" their characters. The main functionality will come with an interactive character sheet that will guide the player and will show them what needs to be rolled and added so that the combat process flows more smoothly. The level up process will also be broken into several prompts that will make the level up process less daunting for new players and quicker for experienced players.<br /><br />link: We are attempting to make an interactive version of this: <img class="filter_urltolink_image" alt="" src="http://realmsgamer.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Character-sheet-pic.jpg" /><br />link to Pathfidner website: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinder/" class="_blanktarget">http://paizo.com/pathfinder/</a><br /><br />Views<br />======<br /><br />* Home (Login/Signup/About) view<br />* About view<br />* User view<br />* Character sheet view<br />* Character sheet creation view<br />* Character sheet edit view<br />* Character Level up view<br />* Character sheet Real Time view<br /><br />Stakeholders<br />============<br /><br />* Players<br /><br />Names<br />======<br /><br />* Morgan Garske<br />* Justin Huffman<br />* Jenaer Rader<br /><br />Qualifications<br />==============<br /><br />* Knowledge of ruby on rails, sass applications, and javascript.<br />* Knowledge of Agile design proccess</p></body></html>
