			About Dungeon Helper</h1>
		<div class = "aboutbody">
			Dungeon Helper is a character sheet creator and manager for the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG">Pathfinder Roleplaying Game</a>. As a group of avid tabletop gamers, we have often found it somewhat tedious to carry around a bunch of character sheets which eventually become unreadable due to all the erasing and re-writing and pizza, and frequently get lost. To fix this issue, we have created (or are in the process of creating) Dungeon Helper, a tool for table top gamers that allows them to easily create new characters and have one place in the cloud to access them all from any computer.</div>
